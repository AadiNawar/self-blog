Portfolio Site
===============

A modern, responsive personal portfolio site scaffold using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Getting started
---------------
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use a simple static server).

2. Replace placeholder images in `assets/` with your own assets (profile, project screenshots).

3. Edit content directly in the HTML files: `index.html`, `about.html`, `projects.html`, `contact.html`.

Options
-------
- For local development with live reload, use a static server like `live-server` or VS Code Live Server extension.
- To use GSAP animations, the scaffold already links the CDN; remove if not wanted.

Customization notes
-------------------
- Theme colors are in `styles/style.css` :root variables.
- Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts in each HTML file.
- Navigation is responsive with a simple mobile toggle in `scripts/main.js`.

Tech icons
----------
This scaffold uses Font Awesome for tech and social icons. Edit the lists in `about.html` and the footer to add/remove icons. Example classes:

 - HTML: `fab fa-html5`
 - CSS: `fab fa-css3-alt`
 - JavaScript: `fab fa-js`
 - Python: `fab fa-python`
 - React: `fab fa-react`

Deployment
----------
You can host this as a static site anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel). For GitHub Pages, push this folder to a repo and enable Pages from the repository settings.
